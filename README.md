[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/RelationalAI-oss/Salsa.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/RelationalAI-oss/Salsa.jl)

A framework for on-demand, incremental computation via memoization, inspired by Rust lang's

## Warning
This package is in early stages of work-in-progress, and changing frequently.

## Credits
This package was closely modelled off of the Rust
[`salsa`](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa) framework, and takes heavy inspiration from
that framework and [adapton](http://adapton.org/).
